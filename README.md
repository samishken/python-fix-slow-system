Create a pool object of the Pool class of a specific number of CPUs your system has by passing a number of tasks you have. Start each task within the pool object by calling the map instance method, and pass the run function and the list of tasks as an argument.Hint: os.walk() generates the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up. This is used to traverse the file system in Python.
